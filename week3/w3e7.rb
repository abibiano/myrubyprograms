#  Exercise7. First of all, I'd like to thank Peter Cooper for allowing me to
#  use this exercise.
#
#  The application you#'re going to develop will be a text analyzer. You will be
#  working on it this and next week. Your Ruby code will read in text supplied
#  in a separate file, analyze it for various patterns and statistics, and print
#  out the results for the user. It's not a 3D graphical adventure or a fancy
#  Web site, but text processing programs are the bread and butter of systems
#  administration and most application development. They can be vital for
#  parsing log files and user-submitted text on Web sites, and manipulating
#  other textual data. With this application you'll be focusing on implementing
#  the features quickly, rather than developing an elaborate object-oriented
#  structure, any documentation, or a testing methodology.
#
#  Your text analyzer will provide the following basic statistics:
#
#  Character count
#  Character count (excluding spaces)
#  Line count
#  Word count
#  Sentence count
#  Paragraph count
#  Average number of words per sentence
#  Average number of sentences per paragraph
#  In the last two cases, the statistics are easily calculated from the word
#  count, sentence count, and paragraph count. That is, once you have the total
#  number of words and the total number of sentences, it becomes a matter of a
#  simple division to work out the average number of words per sentence.
#
#  Before you start to code, the first step is to get some test data that your
#  analyzer can process. You can find the text at:
#  http://rubylearning.com/data/text.txt
#
#  Save the file in the same folder as your other Ruby programs and call it
#  text.txt. Your application will read from text.txt by default (although
#  you'll make it more dynamic and able to accept other sources of data later on).
#
#  Let me outline the basic steps you need to follow:
#
#  Load in a file containing the text or document you want to analyze.
#  As you load the file line by line, keep a count of how many lines there are 
#  (one of your statistics taken care of).
#  Put the text into a string and measure its length to get your character count.
#  Temporarily remove all whitespace and measure the length of the resulting
#  string to get the character count excluding spaces.
#  Split on whitespace to find out how many words there are.
#  Split on full stops (.), #'!' and '?' to find out how many sentences there are.
#  Split on double newlines to find out how many paragraphs there are.
#  Perform calculations to work out the averages.
#  Create a new, blank Ruby source file and save it as analyzer.rb in your Ruby folder.
